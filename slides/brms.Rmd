## R formula syntax

|  term  | meaning | 
| ------ | ------- |
| `y ~ 1 + x` | `y` predicted by `x` (1 = intercept, included by default) |
| `y ~ 1 + x + z + x:z` | two variables and interaction (equivalent to `y ~ x*z`) | 
| `(1 | g)` | allow the intercept to vary by levels of `g` | 
| `(1 + x | g)` | allow intercept and slope to vary and model correlation between these 'random effects' |
| `(0 + x | g)` | fixed intercept, random slope |
| `(1 + x || g)` | model random effects but not correlation (fix $\rho$ to 0) |
