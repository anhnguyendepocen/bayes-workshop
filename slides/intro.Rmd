<br>

In `R` set working directory to `bayes-workshop` (or `bayes-workshop-master`)

## Workshop Overview

We will cover:

- A review of linear and generalized mixed models
- A conceptual introduction to Bayesian analysis (+ MCMC sampling basics)
- The `brms` package 
- Example analyses 

I've tried to include links throughout that will be useful when you come to run your own Bayesian analyses
