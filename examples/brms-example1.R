### brms - example 1
### In this example we use the 'sleepstudy' data set
### which contains the average reaction times of 
### participants with 0-9 days of sleep deprivation
### 
### We start with a simple regression model that 
### does not account for the clustering in the data
### (mutliple RTs from the same Subjects) and then 
### build on this model to include random effects
###
### This example introduces gaussian models in brms,
### comparing models (loo, waic, bayes_factor),
### posterior predictive checks, working with posterior samples
###
### This example is used throughout the brms.html slides

#### EXTRA STUFF -----
## this goes beyond what we cover in the slides
## it covers possible extentions to the models
## considered above. This is mainly to show 
## additional functionality of brms...

### monotonic predictor
# it may be that the change in reaction time with days
# is monotonically increasing but not at a consistent 
# rate (i.e., the change across adjacent days may differ)
# it is possible to incorporate these assumptions and model
# days as a 'monotonic effect' using mo() 
# see https://psyarxiv.com/9qkhj/ for detail

m4 = brm(Reaction ~ mo(Days) + (1 + mo(Days) | Subject), data = sleepstudy,

         prior=priors,

         sample_prior = T) 

m4 = add_criterion(m4, c("loo", "waic", "marglik"))

loo_compare(m3, m4, criterion = "loo")

bayes_factor(m3,m4)

### distributional model
# with increasing days of sleep deprivation
# there may be increasing measurement error
# from sources not included in our model.
# brms allows you to model other parameters
# of the response distribution (i.e, not just the mean).
# So we can let the residual variance (sigma) vary.
# Below we just model sigma with a fixed effect of 
# Days but you could consider more complex models
# see vignette("brms_distreg", package = "brms")

m5_form = bf(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days | Subject),
