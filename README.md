# Bayesian analysis with R using brms and Stan

- This is where the materials for the Rotman Research Institute workshop on Bayesian analysis will go.

- This is a work in progress but the materials will be available before the workshop on the 25th of October.

## Description

This workshop will introduce attendees to Bayesian data analysis and the `R` package [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html). `brms` stands for 'Bayesian Regression Models using [`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org/)' and, as the name suggests, it provides a flexible interface to `Stan`, which is a powerful program for fitting Bayesian models. `brms` can handle a wide range of models and data types and this workshop will cover several example analyses, with a particular focus on (generalized) linear mixed effects models. These example analyses will cover the setting of prior distributions on model parameters, assessing model convergence and fit, and model comparison. The workshop will also introduce the `Stan` model language so attendees can start to implement their own bespoke models, as well as better understand what `brms` is doing 'under the hood'.

## Objectives

1. To give a conceptual understanding of Bayesian data analysis
2. Introduce the `brms` package for `R`
3. Work on several example analyses
    - specifying the model
    - choosing priors
    - evaluating convergence
    - posterior predictive checks
    - model comparison (including Bayes' factors)
4. Introduce the `Stan` model language and work through some examples

## Requirements

(More may be added here)

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

In RStudio type:

```
install.packages(c("brms", "rstan", "bayesplot", "coda")) # this might take a while...
```
